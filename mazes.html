<h1>Mazes</h1>

<p>I've loved mazes ever since I was a kid. Click on a maze below to view it full-size or print it out.</p>

<p>The mazes below are inspired by Boston's road madness. There are no dead ends, only endless bridges and underpasses. Once you're going a certain direction, you can't turn around; and like on a highway, you can take either fork when the road divides but not when it merges. The two large arrows are the start and end points; small arrows indicate one-way road sections.</p>

<p>This last one needs to be printed out. The colored lines are creases in the paper; at any point, you can stop and fold the maze along either crease. All paths that cross the pink crease will match up to new paths, opening up some routes and closing off others.</p>
