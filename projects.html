<h1>Projects I'm proud of</h1>

        <h2><a href="http://www.discotest.org" target="_blank">DiscoTest</a></h2>

        <p><a href="http://www.lectica.org" target="_blank">Lectica</a> builds open-ended formative standardized assessment systems designed a) to honor the rich diversity of students' perspectives, and b) to trigger iterative cycles of learning & feedback in students, teachers, administrators, and developmental researchers.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.discotest.org" target="_blank">DiscoTest</a> is Lectica's platform for designing, validating, administering, scoring, and reporting on Lectical assessments for K-12 students. DiscoTest was the most inspiring, technically interesting, and conceptually challenging project I've worked on to date.</p>

        <p><strong>The fun parts:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Designing and querying an extremely complex relational data schema</li>
          <li>Interfaces to give the admin full control over managing, editing, and using the coding rubrics</li>
          <li>Auto-generated multi-page reports for individual students as well as filterable reports that allows teachers, administrators, and researchers to analyze aggregate results, generate custom charts, etc.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-66">
        <p>Lux gathers research on startups, builds reports and metrics about their viability, potential market size, etc. then gives access to these reports to subscribers.</p>
        <p>I was tasked to implement a "chart explorer" interface to allow customers to explore their companies database in a visual and dynamic way, with customizable X and Y axes, filters to constrain results along a number of dimensions, controls to save and load chart settings, and export to PNG or CSV. The chart is refreshed via AJAX each time a setting is changed.</p>
        <p>This was about 30% Rails and 70% Javascript (my first time working with <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a>) and was a ton of fun.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-66">
        <p>Gray Owl manages a library of finance, banking, and insurance related resources available for subscriber access. As part of the team planning and building the application, I mostly worked on integrating machine learning & automation tools into the app interface and data flow.</p>

        <p><strong>The fun parts:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Storing certain file attachments in dynamically named S3 buckets (1 per user for legal reasons)</li>
          <li>Machine learning integration (training, prediction, and evaluating accuracy) using a Prediction.io server, queried from our main Rails app</li>
          <li>Spin off short-lived EC2 instances from an AMI, to each crawl a single domain, write newly found links to a central database, then terminate; logging & interface to provide transparency into what each crawler instance is doing</li>
          <li>Audit records of all changes are stored in a secondary database and can be reviewed by authorized users</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Thriveability project aims to build a social networking & collaboration hub that supports deeper discourse and more reflective engagement with the people around you. It's an antithesis to the shallow infosharing and "ADD culture" often cultivated by Facebook, Twitter, and similar.</p>
